# Functional
- As a user, I can select a model file of the specified formats to upload.
- I can upload models created using Pytorch.
- I can upload models created using Keras.
- I can upload models created using scikit-learn.
- I can upload models in the ONNX format.
- As a user, I can see the full graph of a valid uploaded model once it finishes processing.
- As a user, I can pan and zoom the model visualization.
- The model visualization includes nodes, links, and activation functions.
- As a user, I can hover activation function icons to see the exact type of function.
- As a user, I can click on nodes and node collections to see bias information or layer count information.
- As a user, I can hover links to see weight information.
- As a user, I can get back to the default graph view if I lose it.
- As a user, it is clear to me how nodes and links are color-coded to represent their values.
- As a user, I can show the application in both light and dark modes, depending on my preferences.
- If a model fails to upload and render, I get a notification that accurately and simply describes why.
- For node collections, I can see some statistics on the group as a whole, such as average, minimum, and maximum values.
- As a user, it is clear how models should be formatted for proper upload.
- As a user, I can collapse layers to make the graph more readable.
- I can export the graph as an SVG image.
- I can export the graph to LaTeX tikz syntax.
- I can input sample data and watch the feed-forward process in action by stepping through.
- Feed-forward steps can be exported to a series of LaTeX tikz graphs.

# Non-Functional
- Large network layers are collapsed if they are too big to reasonably render.
- For visually impaired users, aria labels exist for screen readers where possible.
- If the site takes a long time to load, skeletonized components are shown to indicate that the site is still loading.
- As a user, my data is reasonably secure, both during transmission and processing.
- Themes are sufficiently differentiable for colorblind users.
- Invalid models are rejected and not stored on the server unnecessarily.
